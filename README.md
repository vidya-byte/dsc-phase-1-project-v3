# Phase 1 Project Description

## Project Overview

The data is from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
The project intend to analyze aviation accident data to uncover trends and insights that aids to improve aviation safety, inform aircraft purchases, and make informed choices. Additionally, this project aims to explore the relationships between various factors such as aircraft make/model, weather conditions, and the causes of accidents. Findings from this data will help airlines and aviation organizations make informed decisions about safety improvements, aircraft selection, and risk management.


### Business Problem Statement
The project aims to determine the key factors that causes aircrafts crash that causes fatalities in the United States.specifically, this project aims to:
 *Identify significant features that contribute to aircraft crashes.
 *Explore other correlated features to aircraft crashes.
 
The business problem entails enhancing safety, reducing accidents, and optimizing the management by identifying accident patterns related to aircraft models, weather conditions, human error, and maintenance issues.
The project analysis aims to identify risk factors, and provide actionable insights that can guide airlines, manufacturers, and regulators in improving safety, optimizing aircraft selection, and minimizing accidents. 

### Business Understanding
Have ideas on factors that significantly contribute to aircraft crashes.
Create visualizations that will represent the findings from my analyzed data.The key questions are:
 *Which aircraft makes/models are associated with the highest or lowest fatalities?
 *Which aircraft models are more prone to accidents?
 *How do different weather conditions affect accident rates?
 *What are the main causes of accidents such as mechanical failure?

#### Data Analysis
Entails data cleaning which involves converting necessary columns to numeric types, handle missing data, removing duplicates, outliers and unneccesary rows. In addition, the data should be aggregated to acquire totals for the varibles and grouped relevant data categories.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA that was mostly used was descriptive statistics to calculate mean, median, and standard deviation. It was also used to calculate accident distribution by aircraft model and weather conditions.
The visualizations used were:
*The heatmap to show the correlation between injuries and survivals.
*The bar chart to visualize the frequency of accidents by aircraft model.
*The histogram to analyze the distribution of fatalities of aircraft engine types.
*The box plot was to show the outliers, the total fatal injuries caused by various aircrafts under various weather conditions.
*The pie chart visualizes the distribution of weather conditions and fatalities caused on that particular weather.
    
### Non-Technical Presentation
Analyzing historical aviation accident data can predict patterns on which aircraft models are safer, how weather impacts flight safety, and what factors contribute to most accidents. Based on these ideas, it can help airlines, manufacturers, and regulators make an informed choice that will improve the overall safety while minimizing future risks.

### Business Success Criteria
For the business to be a sucess, it should achieved most or all of the following demands to curb accidents:
*Enhanced aircraft safety.
*Accurate identification of risk factors.
*Improved weather planning and response.
*Have achieved cost reduction such as operational costs, maintenance, insurance, and liability expenses.

### Recommendations
For the commercial purposes, the airlines should focus on purchasing aircraft models with strong safety records based on the analyzed data.
Improve weather-related safety accidents such as pilot training for adverse conditions, upgrade weather monitoring systems, regular aircraft maintenance especially the engines, and focus on allievating human error.

### Next steps
More research should be done to create predictive models that will tell the likelihood of an accident by various factors.
Test and implement the recommendations.
Report and communicate the findings.
Intergrate the feedback and and iterate.
